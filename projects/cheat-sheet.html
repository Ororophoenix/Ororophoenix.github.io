<h3>What is it</h3>
<p>CSS is a stylesheet language that describes the presentation of an HTML document. CSS arranges elements on the html document for style, font, color, and effects to appear on a website or other media formats.</p>

<h3>Important Syntax Rules</h3>
<p>A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.w3schools.com/css/selector.gif"/></p>
<p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>
<p>ID Selector:
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. An id should be unique within a page, so the id selector is used if you want to select a single, unique element. To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.</p>
<p>Class Selector:
The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class. You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class. By writing <code>p.class_name</code></p>
<p>Grouping Selectors:
If you have elements with the same style definitions you can group them together to avoid repetition. You can group the selectors, to minimize the code. To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.
<code>h1, h2, p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}</code></p>
