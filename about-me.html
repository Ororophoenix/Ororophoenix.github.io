      <h4> Hey Yall!</h4>
      <p>
        So as it says in the header my name is Monique Williamson. I grew up in Dayton, OH before going to college at Ohio University to major is psychology. After that I moved way out to Nebraska to get a master's in marriage and family therapy. Then I moved one more time to start a Ph.D. in child development and family studies. While in my Ph.D program I realized that I did not want to be in school anymore. I had been in school since I was 3, it was time to take a break. So I took my MFT license test and passed on the first try (winning!). I got a job as a therapist in Columbus at head start working with the children and their familes. I loved and hated it. My kids were great and gave me really funny stories but I couldn't handle all of the stress.</p>
      <p>
       So you might be thinking "Girl you got a masters degree and started a Ph.D in the field, suck it up." I ain't gonna do it. So now I am in the process of completely losing my mind and attempting to become a software developer. How did I make that big jump you ask? I'll let you know when I figure it out. Until then lets see what I can create!.</p>

        A little bit of info about me outside of the resume breakdown. I love to read I am getting close to reading 550 books. I keep track of them all in a Barbie notebook I've had since I was about 11.  I love to cook so I might eventually add a page about some of the food I make. And last but not least, I am OBSESSED with my bucket list. It's a single spaced nine page word document. I keep it updated, items get moved to the top when they are on deck and highlighted when they are finished. So maybe I will also add a travel page. Okay I am going to stop talking now before I think of more pages to add and create more work for myself. Have fun lookng around!</p>
