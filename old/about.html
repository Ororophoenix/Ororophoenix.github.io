					<h3>Diversify</h3>
					<p>
						A social justice web app that matches users with different demographics that have similar interests. For two weeks two users would be matched and could communicate by sending messages through the app in real time. At the end of those two weeks all users would be provided a new match. Diversify was created to aid the end of discrimination and unacknowledged stereotypes. I believe that the best way to end discrimination is with honest conversation, understanding and friendship. Diversify is built for anyone who is looking to expand their knowledge of other people and cultures.

					<h3>BookRant</h3>
					<p>
						Coming Soon!
						A web app that allows you a open space to vent about books and not worry about giving away any spoilers! BookRant allows users to find books they have read and talk to the community about their feelings. Users don't have t sensor themselves because everybody has already read the book too!
