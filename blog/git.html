      Over the past week at DBC I have been stuffing my brain with concept after concept and what I know beyond a shadow of a doubt is that version control is important! Everybody had that one incident in high school or college when you were three pages into a five page paper and somehow, someway, by some nefarious trick of satan. Boom! Your paper is gone. Never to be seen or heard from again, with no way to recover it and no hope of sleep for the next two days. Well, version control fights that with commits.

      Git allows you to keep track of changes by using frequent commits. Commits are screenshots of your work. Good programmers add notes into their code but git also allows you to write commit messages. Commit messages are helpful because they state what the programmer was working on at the time of the commit. This allows you to come back to a previous commit (screenshot) and know what needs to be worked on.

      Github is the candy land of coding. Except itâ€™s free, which makes it even better. Github allows you to access your code from anywhere. It also allows coders to share their source code with others to get feedback or to be inspired.
