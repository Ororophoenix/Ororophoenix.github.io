    <p>Borders, Margins, Padding, and Jail</p>
    <p>What is the difference between margin, border, and padding?</p>

    Gather round kids because I got a story to tell. Ok well maybe not a story but I'm bout to drop some knowledge so let's do this.</p> 
<p>
    I'm going to start with a border. Every box or element has a border even if it is invisible it exists. (FYI an element is the content of a webpage) Think of this as your personal space. (I call it my bubble) Each box sits within its bubble. If you are like my best friend then your bubble is fairly small if you are like me then your bubble is pretty large. The edge of your bubble is your border. The point is the bubble can shrink or increase based upon preference. It is the same with a border. You can expand or shrink it in CSS based on your preference. </p>
<p>
    Margin is the limits outside of the border. So to picture this, imagine you're in jail because somebody violated your bubble (border) and you had to give them the business (that means fight them for all the slang challenged out there). Now you are sitting in solitary confinement. You still have your personal space bubble (border) but now you also have a jail cell which you can picture as your margin. </p>
<p>
    And last is padding allows you to decide how much space you want between the content of an element and its border. Ok now work with me here because I am strangely invested in making this jail analogy work and this might get a little tricky. Your jail cell is the margin, your personal space bubble is your border and your padding would be your clothes. Put on more clothing and you have less space in between your border and your body. If you have on less clothing there is more space between the edge of your bubble and your body (If you are thinking "well clothing doesn't take up that much space". You clearly aren't from Ohio. In winter I usually have on no less than three layers of clothes).</p>
<p>
    So let's run through this one more time for clarity. Your body is the element, your clothing is the padding, your personal space bubble is the border and your jail cell is the margin. They all exist at the same time and they all can be increased or decreased depending on preference.</p>
<p>
    P.S. I won't lie I'm pretty happy that random jail analogy worked. </p>
