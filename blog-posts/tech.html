    <p>The Internet: So it does what exactly...</p>
    <p>You get internet, you get internet, EVERYBODY GETS INTERNET!</p>

<p>I realized that as a software developer I should probably know the basics about the internet. Yea I pretty much didn't before I wrote this but I do not and thats what matters, so no judgment!</p>

<p>But what is the internet? Most of us just think of it as this invisible mass that just exists. We dont question why it just is. Well the internet is a linked worldwide computer network. "The Internet is a collection of standalone computers (and computer networks in companies, schools, and colleges) all loosely linked together, mostly using the telephone network. The connections between the computers are a mixture of old-fashioned copper cables, fiber-optic cables (which send messages in pulses of light), wireless radio connections (which transmit information by radio. waves), and satellite links." <a href="http://www.explainthatstuff.com/internet.html">Source</a></p>

<p>So guess what. The internet is actually pretty basic AF. All it does is move information around. Yea, anticlimactic, I know. But thats what it does. The acutal internet does not store any data or process it. All of that happens in your computer hardware. All of the applications and programs that we use on the internet? Well once again that happens in some hardware somewhere but the internat doesnt have anything to do with that. The perfect example is github. Github stores information that you send from your computer. Somewhere in the world (San Francisco) Github is storing your data for you. You send that information through the internet to github but it does not store the data on the internet it stores it probably in a room full of computers at the github headquarters. </p>

<p>Well if the internet is only moving data how does it do that? Lets take a stroll down memory lane shall we. If you were born before the early 90's you probably remember dial-up internet and how terribly slow it was. The internet used to use telephone lines to move data. Now there a many more advanced ways to do this. This is called circuit switching. There are many other ways of connecting to the internet now that we are in the 21st century. There is broadband, satellite and cable internet. All of these methods do the same thing just by different methods. </p>

<p>See that wasn't so bad but for the people who aren't as fond of reading I will sum it up for you.
TL;DR The internet moves data that is stored using satelittes, telephone wires etc.</p>
