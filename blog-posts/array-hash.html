    <p>Arrays, Hashes and Movie References</p>

      Hey y'all so this week we are going to be talking about arrays and hashes. Letâ€™s get started.</p>

    <p>
      So you might be wondering why I wrote movie references in the title. Well its because I have the perfect movie reference to explain this and its one that pretty much everyone has seen at least once.</p>

      Ok now that the movie question has been answered lets get started for real.</p>

    <p>
      An array is simply a list. Just like on a piece of paper you can write words, letters or numbers in a list, you can add words, letters, or numbers to an array. Sooooooo what does Monsters Inc. have to do with this? It's the perfect physical representation of what an array is capable of. So you know how Mike would always bring a door for Sully to use. Well us developers, we're Mike, and the items in the array are the doors. So lets say Mike wants to bring down Boo's door. Well her door has a specific iidentifying number associated with it. This is her index number. Lets say her number is 777. In ruby it would look like this kids_doors[777]. This command would bring Boo's door from that big storage room where they fought that evil lizard (Ralph, Randy, Richard I can never remember his name). So in the monsters inc world they would have a physical door and in our world ruby will output that item in the list.

      A hash is a set of information. Think of it like an information buddy system. One buddy is the key and the other is the value. To continue with the Monsters in references we are going to use the Scarers (Sully) and their Scare Assistants (Mike). The Scare Assistants are the key and the Scarers are the value. If you want to talk to Sully while he is working you have to call Mike first and then he will get you Sully. Why is this useful? Why can't I just go get Sully? Well, for one he's working so don't be rude and two you may not know who Sully is. So in a computer if you wanted to look up scarers you can search their assistants and find the corresponding scarer.
      scare_employees = {"Mike" ==> "Sully", "Tyrone" ==>"Monique", "Whoever Beyonce's Assistant is" ==> "Beyonce"}
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrays and hashes are really useful once you become used to working with them. There is a lot of data in the world and it needs to be organized. This is a couple quick ways to start.
