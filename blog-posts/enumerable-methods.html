    <p>Week-5 Enumerable Map</p>
    <p>Enumerable Maps are like Google Maps right???</p>
</section>
<section class = "blog-content">
<p>To answer the question in the title, no. Enumerables are nothing like Google maps unfortunately. Maybe if it was it would be easier to understand. So the analogy for this week is gonna be video games! Right about now you are probably wondering how I am going to make that work. Oh ye of little faith. Have thou not seen displays of my mastery of random tech analogies. If not pop on over to some of my other blog posts. If you have and you still have doubt let's do this.(no joke in my head the street fighter music just started playing and I was like ready...fight! Oh the precious nerd moments.)</p>
<p>Ok so how is an enmerable like a video game? The simple way of looking at it is you unlock different methods when you include enmerable the same way you unlock weapons, powers, or different levels in a video game.</p>

<p>Do you see the guy with the lollipop. Yea thats me and thats the first weapon you start off with. I needed to gain experience points and money so I could level up and use the sword with the dragons face on it. Luckily for us all we have to do to access enumerable methods is write: include Enumerable. Yea, its that easy.</p>
<p>Now we need to explain what Enumerable map does. According to our wonderful Patron Saint Ruby Docs map returns a new array with the results of running block once for every element in enum. What does this mean? Pretty much it means you will get a new array with the names things in it. Yes really, it's that simple. Map takes an enumerable object and ablock, and runs the block for each element, outputting each returned value from the block. The iportant thing to not is that the original object is not effected by this process. If you do want to change the original you can use map! to do that. What's even better map has a twin called collect. So you can have the same fun using two enumerables. </p>
