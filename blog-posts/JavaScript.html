    <p>JavaScript Objects vs Ruby Hashes</p>
</section>
<section class = "blog-content">
<p>Hey Yall! So this week we are going to jump into some new material...JavaScript! DUN DUN DUNNNNNN (cue classic horror music).

Ok maybe that was a bit dramatic Javascript isn't that bad. Just like anything else it takes some getting used to. The biggest problem is trying to keep the languages straight in your head.</p>

<p>So today we are going to learn about the differences between Ruby's hashes and Javascript's Objects. Well Im just gonna start this off by telling you the truth. THey aren't that different. Yea. I know. Anticlimactic. But that's just the truth. So lets go nitpicking for details.</p>

<p>Ok actually lets clarify what a Javascript object is first. An object is a list of data thats stored as pairs. The name of your object should usually be a string. Technically it can be a number but you dont want those problems so just listen and stick with a string. You can put prety much anything inside your object so feel free to have a great time with that. </p>

<p>Still waiting on the differences aren't you. Yea I dont blame you especially sinces that the whole point of this article. Ok there are two main differences between hashes and objects, object functions and object constructors. Object constructors are actually similar to Ruby classes. it allows for information to be passed between mothds and making it easier to implement as a whole. When it comes to object functions lets just start with the fact that Ruby doesnt have functions. A object function can be used multiple ways it can store a method, or print out a sentence from other functions. It's pretty useful.
</p>
<p>So thats the quick and dirty rundown of ruby hashes vs JavaScript objects.</p>
