•	What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
o	This challenged helped me actually put the skills o use and realize what I need more help on. I am still figuring out margins but I think I am doing really well with borders and padding. 
•	What did you learn about CSS positioning?
o	I am really struggling with positioning. I think I am still trying to figure out all of the commands. For example I wrote inline:block. It took me at least ten minutes to figure out why it wasn’t working. And I changed it to display:inline-block. I think positioning will get better when I become more used to the commands. 
•	What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
o	I have no idea how to add my triangle. I figured out how to make a triangle but I could not understand how to put my text inside of it. I want to continue to improve upon the website and hopefully I will be able to add it later on when I have more experience. The easiest for me to implement was creating the blocks and choosing all of the details. 
•	What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
o	I learned how important it is to use specific classes in the html document. Life got so much easier when I split my html up into classes and then I could change individual elements.
