<--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
I was the driver while creating the wireframe and it was great. I showed my partner a idea I already created. He thought that it was good so we went with that. While I was creating it he gave really good ideas that would make the page more user friendly. I was the navigator while we created the HTML page and it was really helpful to hear his thoughts on how to create our blog page because I was not really sure where to start.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Absolutely. I am not sure what we would have done if we didn't have the wireframe as a template before trying to create it in HTML.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We went with a page that included a link to the home page, contact page, about me page and a navigation bar so users could vist the previous 2 and next 2 blog posts on the site.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I learned how to implement div in a practical setting.-->
